# Lua Commands

These custom commands are optional and only loaded if specified at runtime.
These are meant to assist in providing efficient handling of specific patterns
while working with Redis.

The custom commands are added to our custom `flowlib` which you can add to your
`.flowconfig` like-so:

```
[libs]
./node_modules/ioredis-utils/flowlibs
```
